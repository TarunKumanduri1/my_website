### Reducing Nitrogen Loss in the Chesapeake Bay  
![ ](images/projects/nitrogen_project.png){width=400px}

Developed a comprehensive nitrogen supply chain model in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), integrating 7+ datasets related to crop production, livestock, and interstate trade. The model supports market-based strategies for reducing nitrogen loss across the Chesapeake Bay region. Built interactive visualizations using Python Dash to communicate findings to stakeholders and assist in advancing USDA’s 2030 and 2050 nitrogen reduction goals.

**Tools & Technologies:** Python, Data Modeling, Dash, PyCharm, ETL  
**GitHub:** [View Repo](https://github.com/TarunKumanduri1/Nitrogen-Flow-Model-for-Chesapeake-Bay-Regio)

### ️ Interactive Dashboard – Nitrogen Loss in Food Industry  
![ ](images/projects/nitrogen-dashboard.png){width=400px}

Designed and deployed an interactive public-facing dashboard to visualize county-level nitrogen loss within the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The dashboard uses Python Dash and choropleth maps to allow users to explore geographic nitrogen trends and agricultural emissions. Built as a companion tool to the USDA nitrogen reduction model and deployed on a custom domain for open access by researchers and policy analysts.

**Tools & Technologies:** Python Dash, Choropleth Maps, Web Deployment

### Energy Data Collection for Renewable Plants  
![ ](images/projects/energy-data.jpg){width=400px}

Processed and structured over 66,000 climate data files (wind, solar radiation, and temperature) sourced from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), covering 11,000+ energy plant locations across the United States. Developed a climate data repository to support renewable energy forecasting and infrastructure planning. Applied K-means clustering to identify regional climate trends and automated the data pipeline using API integrations and custom ETL workflows.

**Tools & Technologies:** R, APIs, K-means Clustering, ETL, Web Scraping

### EV Supply Chain Modeling  
![ ](images/projects/ev-supply.png){width=400px}

Built a simulation model to assess the life cycle environmental impact of electric vehicle (EV) production under various manufacturing and sourcing scenarios. The project evaluates the benefits of onshoring EV component manufacturing to the U.S., incorporating emissions data from global supply chains and accounting for regional grid carbon intensity. Used scenario analysis to explore trade-offs in energy use, resource efficiency, and carbon emissions across future policy pathways.

**Tools & Technologies:** Python, Data Modeling, Pandas, Scenario Analysis, Matplotlib
