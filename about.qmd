# About Me

I'm **Tarun Kumanduri**, a data-driven problem solver and graduate student in the **Data Analytics** program at **The George Washington University**. My work lies at the intersection of **data science**, **machine learning**, and **cloud engineering**, where I transform complex datasets into real-world insights and applications.

Currently, I work as a **Graduate Research Assistant**, where I've built large-scale ETL pipelines, interactive dashboards, and ML models to support projects involving energy systems, policy, and environmental analysis. I’ve also led public-sector analytics efforts as a **District Data Coordinator** with Inqui-Lab Foundation in collaboration with **UNICEF** and the **Government of Telangana**.

In addition to my academic and technical work, I actively volunteer with **The Art of Living Foundation**, where I organised and assisted mindfulness, yoga, and personality development workshops for students and professionals — helping over 1,800 individuals enhance focus and well-being. I'm also a strong community builder, currently serving as the **Finance Director of GW Desis** and **Digital Marketing Director of the Google Developer Student Club at GW**.

I recently developed a **survey application using R Shiny** and built this **personal website using Quarto**, combining my skills in full-stack data workflows and communication.

Beyond my technical interests, I enjoy playing chess, staying updated on current affairs, exploring philosophy, and watching cricket and movies — a mix that keeps me curious, grounded, and connected.
