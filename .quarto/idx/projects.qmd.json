The model supports market-based strategies for reducing nitrogen loss across the Chesapeake Bay region. Built interactive visualizations using Python Dash to communicate findings to stakeholders and assist in advancing USDA’s 2030 and 2050 nitrogen reduction goals.\n\n**Tools & Technologies:** Python, Data Modeling, Dash, PyCharm, ETL  \n**GitHub:** [View Repo](https://github.com/TarunKumanduri1/Nitrogen-Flow-Model-for-Chesapeake-Bay-Regio)\n\n---\n\n### ️ Interactive Dashboard – Nitrogen Loss in Food Industry  \n![ ](images/projects/nitrogen-dashboard.png){width=400px}\n\nDesigned and deployed an interactive public-facing dashboard to visualize county-level nitrogen loss within the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The dashboard uses Python Dash and choropleth maps to allow users to explore geographic nitrogen trends and agricultural emissions. Built as a companion tool to the USDA nitrogen reduction model and deployed on a custom domain for open access by researchers and policy analysts.\n\n**Tools & Technologies:** Python Dash, Choropleth Maps, Web Deployment  \n**GitHub:** [View Repo](https://github.com/TarunKumanduri1/Chesapeake-Bay-Nitrogen-Loss-Dashboard)\n\n---\n\n### Energy Data Collection for Renewable Plants  \n![ ](images/projects/energy-data.jpg){width=400px}\n\nProcessed and structured over 66,000 climate data files (wind, solar radiation, and temperature) sourced from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), covering 11,000+ energy plant locations across the United States. Developed a climate data repository to support renewable energy forecasting and infrastructure planning. Applied K-means clustering to identify regional climate trends and automated the data pipeline using API integrations and custom ETL workflows.\n\n**Tools & Technologies:** R, APIs, K-means Clustering, ETL, Web Scraping  \n**GitHub:** [View Repo](https://github.com/TarunKumanduri1/NREL_ENERGY_DATA_PROCESSING)\n\n---\n\n### Survey Modeling & Deployment – Charleston Area  \n![ ](images/projects/survey-app.jpg){width=400px}\n\nDesigned and deployed an R Shiny app for real-time demographic data collection.
